## Overview

This repository contains a simple Python reverse shell implementation.  
It can be used to understand basic networking concepts, socket programming, and client-server interactions in Python.

---

## Features

- Connects from a client machine to a server over TCP
- Sends commands from the server to the client
- Executes commands on the client and returns output
- Lightweight and easy to understand for learning purposes

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Network access between client and server (can run locally with 127.0.0.1 for testing)

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/TheToex/ReverseShell.git
cd ReverseShell

2. Start the server.py in your server:

python3 server.py

3. Edit the reverseshell.py and set your server IP

4. run or bind reverseshell.py with other application(may need antivirus evasion)

5. Use the server console to send commands to the client.
